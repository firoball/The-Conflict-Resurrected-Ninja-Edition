The Conflict - Resurrected Ninja Edition
A time travel in 5kb source code

Released at Conitec spring contest'12


Running:

For running this demo, go to TCRNE_compiled folder and run
the EXE. It will try to find the best resolution for your
system automatically.
Do NOT run this in windowed mode!!
The maximum fps are not limited, and high framerates (like it
usually happens windowed mode) will terribly break the sync 
of this demo.


Source:

If you want to take a look at the source code and the used
resources, check the TCRNE_source folder.
For running the uncompiled version, you need an Acknex8
installation, as parts of the engine templates are used.
Your edition should support shaders.
This demo was created and tested with V8.20.1 Pro and may
have problems with different engine releases.


History:

Back in 2001 the original version of "The Conflict" was 
released for a fun Contest at Dusmania'01.
There was not much time left, so the whole thing was hacked 
together very quick and dirty.
With the announcement of the ninja coder contest I saw a
chance to make some good use of this old demo and stripped
the source code size down from 45kb to 5kb without losing
features. I added some more stuff instead.


Legal stuff:
 
Music is property of Nightbeat and usage was granted for this project only.


Addendum 04/2017:

This project remained unversioned until now and was uploaded as is.
Please respect license.txt.
